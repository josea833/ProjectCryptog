This code as both the A5/1 stream cipher and DES cipher in one file because that is what was easier for me. I have written out all of the tables that were provided and converted them into binary. The A5/1 stream cipher has a 32 bit keystream that will encrypt and decrypt the given message then displays it after the stream generation. The DES does the requirement that is given from the assignement except for the expansion the hex to binary wasnt converting because it was private i did not have time to fix this probleem so it i was unfortunatly unable to fix it but the ohers do work.
